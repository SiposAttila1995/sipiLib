# Otls / How to install:
Copy the content of the otls folder into here: `c:\Users\username\Documents\houdinixx.x\otls`


# Disclaimer:
I don't provide support.

Keep in mind, these tools are there for free, and they are not some officially released/acclaimed thing. This is just a fun project for myself, and I publish them only because others - mainly beginners - may learn something from them if they look inside, and then they can build things for themselves. I encourage everybody to build their own tools, suited for their own needs.

You can make suggestions about how to change a HDA, adding a feature, etc, but I can't promise that I will make it happen. These HDAs are the way they are because they suit _my_ workflow and needs. So usually I'm not a fan of these suggestions. Especially since the tools are not locked and anyone can customize them to their specific needs and taste.

However I always appreciate it if you bring a bug to my attention, I care about that.


Best wishes!

Attila
